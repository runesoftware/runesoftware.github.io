<h2>There is a lot to learn before you can become a professional software developer</h2>
<p>If you look at a typical job posting for a developer these days you'll find countless acronyms and a huge list of technologies they expect you to know well. On top of all of that, they usually want you to have some number of years of experience.</p>
<p><strong>And when you are just getting started, <em>you've even gotta learn what it is you need to learn!</em></strong></p>
<p>When you don't know what all you need to know to get a dev job, you aren't sure how to go about learning it all, and what learning resources to use... or how to find jobs, successfully interview, and negotiate an offer... the idea of landing your first programming gig is a daunting task.</p>
<h1>What if you could get a job as a software developer in 6 months?</h1>
<p>How would that change your life?</p>
<p>What would it feel like to get paid well to write code?</p>
<h1>Join the Rune Coding Dojo today!</h1>
<p>In order for me to provide the best possible learning experience for my students, I've limited the number of available spots in the dojo to 10.</p>
<p>If you would like to apply to join, please fill out this form and I will get back to you within the next week.</p>
